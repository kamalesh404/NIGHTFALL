# Incident Response
> **Status:** Locked  
> **Owner:** Solo dev / small team  
> **Relevant phase:** Phase 1


On a suspected security incident (credential leak, exploit in the wild, data exposure): rotate
affected secrets (JWT signing key, DB credentials) immediately, assess scope via logs
(08-backend/08-logging-and-monitoring.md), notify affected users if account data was exposed, and
record a postmortem in 16-appendix/01-changelog.md once resolved.
## AI Agent Failure Modes & Implementation Guardrails

Common mistakes AI coding agents make on this file's subject area, and the guardrail to enforce instead:

- **Silent scope creep** — The agent adds fields, endpoints, or systems not specified in this doc 'for completeness.' Only implement what is written here or in packages/config; flag gaps as questions instead of inventing scope.
- **Client-trusting logic** — Any rule that affects score, health, or economy must be enforced server-side. If an agent finds itself writing validation only in client code, that is a bug.
- **Hardcoded balance values** — Damage, speed, HP, timers, and thresholds belong in packages/config JSON/YAML, validated by the matching Zod schema — never inlined as magic numbers in gameplay or UI code.
- **Skipping the schema** — New config fields or network messages must update the corresponding Zod schema in the same change. Code that reads a field the schema doesn't define is a defect, not a shortcut.
- **Untyped network payloads** — All Socket.IO events must use the shared types in packages/protocol. Never emit or handle a raw untyped object literal.
